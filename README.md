This is the Tic Tac Toe game using C++ programming language. I used Raylib graphics. 
This game has a simple interface with 'X' and 'O'. 
In this game, I used X and O as texture which loads and unloads each time. 
When I run in my vs code, this code gives me a flickering screen and I don't know how to solve it.
