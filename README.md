This is the Tic Tac Toe game using C++ programming language. I used Raylib graphics. 
This game has simple interface with 'X' and 'O'. 
In this game, I used X and O as texture which loads and unloads each time. 
In this code when I run in my vs code it gives me flickering screen and don't know how to solve.
